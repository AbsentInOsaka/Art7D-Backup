  <P> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 	In 1957, james Whitney created a film where he attempts to visualize his thoughts. Influenced form psychologist Carl Jung’s writings on alchemy, Whitney sought to give an image to the idea of the unity between cosmic and psychic states. Through hand-drawn animation he attempts to materialize these truly abstract concepts.
	My attempt, however, may not be as scholarly, but it nonetheless attempts to create an image out of something abstract: sound. Inspired by their brilliant layering of sound, I sought to create a visualization of the various instruments of the song Blue Monday by New Order.
	Even though Whitney’s images may have been influenced mainly by writing, throughout his film one can see that the images are clearly lead by the noises in the background. In such case, our projects may have followed the same method.
