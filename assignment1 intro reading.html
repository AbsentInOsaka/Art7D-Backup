  <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “The Medium is the Message” refers to how the message or meaning of a piece of information is derived not from its content but from the manner in which it is delivered. A message can be delivered across a telegraph as code, or as a narration on the radio, or as a visual on the TV, and they would all ultimately have different impacts on its audience. I agree with McLuhan in that different mediums can have different connotations and different ways in which information can be absorbed. This will ultimately decide what the piece of information will mean for the audience. For  example, let’s think about the time when President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his messages to the American people in the form of fireside chats. The name itself already connotes a feeling of warmth and trust, making the president’s voice one of assurance. However, if the president were to make these chats on the TV, the American public would most likely have a different reaction since now they can see rather than just hear. And what the public would see is the president sitting in a wheelchair. Having access to this information would probably change the opinion of many Americans, and it's all because the message was delivered on a different medium that allowed the public to experience another sense dimension in a new way. Now Films had been around for some time before the TV was invented, so the concept of moving pictures with sound is not new at all. What is new is the ability to witness this from the comfort of one’s home, live, and inexpensively. Therefore, it is easy then to make TV a technology that’s part of our everyday life and have an unconscious need for it. As Mcluhan states, “technology” has the “power” to “create its own[...] demand” via “depriv[ing][...]our senses” and “tak[ing] up the role of sight” in the case of the TV (Mcluhan, 15).
The new demand that the technology creates in us “is not independent” of its sensory overload, McLuhan writes. Whether we think about it or not, new technology has the power to take over our way of thinking and how we process information. We desire to stimulate our sense, so when a new technology can achieve to stimulate them differently or in an excessive way, we are bound to seek it out further. That in itself is the “message” that the medium delivers. It goes beyond its content to communicate a new form of communication.
