	 <h2><pre>Strand #1: art as communicator of science
Project: “Liquid Perceptron” (2000) by Hans H. Diebner and Sven Sahle
Link: http://performative-science.de/liquidperceptron2d.html</pre></h2>
	<img src="light.jpg" alt="light" height="510" width="258">
	<p>Explanation: A vast array of “neurons” (light particles) on a projection screen attempt to imitate brain activity visually. The project aims to portray the manner in which neurons on the brain communicate to one another, by allowing people to interact with the neurons on screen and notice their interconnected movement. Thus, this art project acts as a mean to communicate and explain a scientific process to people outside the field of neuroscience.</p>
	<h2><pre>Strand #2: science as means of production
Project: “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative
Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity” Hoax Research Paper by Alan D. Sokal (1996)
Link: http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html</pre></h2>
	<img src="lies.png" alt="lies" height="400" width="350">
	<p>Explanation: Alan Sokal completed a research paper in 1996 that was readily accepted by readers of the American cultural studies journal Social Text. The twist is that the research paper was a hoax, and was littered with scientific errors. Thus, this physicist used the scientific methods of research and publication as a means to critique the contemporary scientific field for its ignorant and muddle thinking.</p>
	<h2><pre>Strand #3: science as art
Project: “Eroticism” (1990) by Helen Chadwick
Link: http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/chadwick-eroticism-t07411 </pre></h2>
	<img src="brain.jpg" alt="brain" height="350" width="400">
	<p>Explanation: The point of the project is to admire the brains as a metaphor for the human consciousness, and how it affects our surroundings. The artist displayed two raw brains side by side on top of wrinkled bed sheets. On e can admire the metaphor and meaning behind the placement, but the raw brain themselves can be admired aesthetically. One way to admire them is by the lack of the skull, which stands as a symbol of our mortality, and instead just admire the consciousness itself. Thus, in this manner the artist used science, in this case our biology, to admire it as art.</p>
	<h2><pre>Strand #4: art and science interchange, combine, flow naturally with one another.
Project: “Microvenus” by Joe Davis (2001)
Link: http://geneticsandculture.com/genetics_culture/pages_genetics_culture/gc_w03/davis_microvenus.htm </pre></h2>
	<img src="bacteria.jpg" alt="bacteria">
	<p>Explanation: Joe Davis attempts to communicate with extraterrestrial life in a method different than radio signals, which is what has been used traditionally. He infused bacteria with different DNA sequences that can be translated into codes of 1s and 0s. Those 1s and 0s are then used to create a pixel-like image. The scientist in this case is also an artist and created a method which blends both fields together to the point where one can’t really differentiate where one field stops and the other starts. </p>
