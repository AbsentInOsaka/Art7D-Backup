    <h2>Intel's ### Drones</h2>
    <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Intel back in 2015 set out to create a light show with 100 drones in the air. With those drones they created 3D figures and shapes that assimilated the sound of the music in the sky above Tornesch, near Hamburg, Germany. Intel’s team would continue to increase the number of operating drones in a show from 100 to 300 with their demonstration at Coachella two years later. Eventually Intel’s team demonstrated a show with 500 drones in the air at the 2018 winter olympics in Pyongyang. I am fascinated with this project because of the possibilities for visual art that their technology displayed. I've always been fascinated with making visuals to create some sort of overwhelming experience in combination with our other senses, as notable in previous projects I’ve shown in class. What the drones do is essentially bring this kind of visual art into something more concrete and tangible. Drones are not behind any sort of screen, they are (somewhat) within our reach. I’d like to have access to these dornes to create a visual experience where their lights are synced to a song. Each drone maybe having a different sort of light, sme lasers, some spotlights, others LEDs, and all of them representing a different instrument of the song. Essentially, this is creating an experience that combines sound, sight, and to an extent, touch, in the sense that the spectacle is no longer limited to a screen (or a platform on stage like a laser show, or regular concert lights). These drones can be right in front of you or above you with the same freedom as a bird.  Of course there are some issues that come aong soemthgn thatlike this,. some people may argue that the use fo drones ofr art may be undemrining the violent use of these machines for war, and surveillance. Others may argue that this is a fight to defeat those stereotypes, but I'm not sure how much I believe that message since a big company is the one funding thsis project. either way, this particular use makes for a stunning light show that I one day hope to experience.</p>

    <p> There's apparently a 1000 (1180 to be exact) drone version made by a Chinese team </p>
