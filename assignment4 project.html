      <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This machine will allow you to go back to a time of neon bright signs and the night city lights (to the best of its abilities). This machine is built with a spinning motor, 8 LEDS, and 2 battery packs. One switch flicks on the LEDS, while the othr flicks on the motor. The LEDs are purposefully placed behind the fan so that they are covered by it. To reveal the LEDs, one must simply turn on the fan. The city artwork was done in photshop, and the container was made out of cardboard from a maruchan soup pack container. The project wa sinspired by the aesthetic of the music subgenre of Waporwave, which focuses on sampling music and tunes from the 80s to create something new today. Th style trelies heavily on a culture of remizxing and , aesthetically speaking, on the look of citites glowing at night. There is something emotive about being surrounded by th nenon and glow of a city at night, na dmany have used it to stylize their art. Examples include other subgenres of Vaporwave such as "Future Funk," the movie "Drive" (2011), and "Only God Forgives" (2013). Upon others. They all share a similar 80s-esque aesthetic, which is also what motivated the look of this website as well. Through this machine I attempted to create the neon glow effect of the city with the addition of the fan motor and blades to give it a s ort of industrial look. Ultimately, behind the facade of the city glows, hides a not-so-pretty system of susteinance.</p>
