    <h2> Article: Social media have become a vital tool for artists — but are they good for art?</h2>
    <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Social Media has become a widespread tool for advertising art due to the copious amounts of people that use sites such as Facebook,Twitter, or Instagram. However, due to the websites’ censorship policies, it may not be the most efficient for artists that feature nudity in their works. As a result of the censorship, many artists find themselves being limited in what they want to express, and therefore creativity may be hindered to some extent, which is understandable. However, because of the censorship laws, many artists have found unique ways to try to get around the nudity censor. That in itself, one could argue, can be a creative process because of the limitations themselves. In hardship or times of struggle is when humans shine the most,I believe.So when we are being told to shut down, some of the most amazing ideas may come forth. This may not be the case everytime I realize, but it can be a positive way to look at censorship problems. </p>

    <h2>Article:Don't Give Me the Numbers—an interview with Ben Grosser about Facebook Demetricator</h2>
    <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Facebook Demetricator is an interesting tool that when applied in a browser it takes out any metric feature of the website. With the tool installed, one is no longer able to see how many friends liked,commented, or shared a certain post. Neither do we see how many notifications we have. What we do see is that SOMEONE has interacted with the post. Therefore, the Demetricator takes our value away from quantity. The creator, Ben Grosser, explains that capitalist urges fuel our want to see numbers grow, whether it be money or the amount of friends we have on Facebook. I feel that it points out a certain “falseness” in our relationship with other people on this site. Because of Facebook’s metric system, we tend to see our “friend” group as a number rather than individuals, and what ensues is a sort of competition where the aim is to see who gathers the most “friends,” shares, or likes. What then becomes our motivation to seek out new people is not the want for companionship but rather the insatiable need to see our numbers grow. I really like the concept, since it essentially takes out the greediness that comes with using Facebook. </p>
