  <P> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Remixing is a a fun and powerful tecnique. Because of the Internet, we now have acess to the past in a way that we weren't able to before. Sounds from both yesteryear and the present, are now available a few clicks away. From written records, to photos, and video, to even music, artists from the Remixing culture now have acess to such a range of samples that can be used in very creative ways. We now have artists such as Negativland, Girl Talk, and The Avalanches to more popular ones such as Kanye West and many others in the hip-hop and rap industry that have built careers (and entire genres (hint hint, the style of this website is an indication)) solely on this concept. Copyign and pasting has noe become an art. And that concept is nothing new. i believe that every piece of art that's created must have been influcenced by something else. Artists don't create in a vacuum, instead the extent of one's creativity is the main factor. We have always influcenced each other in one way or noather,this art just puts that to the forefront, and that's alright. How dull would art look now, if we weren't allowed to borrow from each other? To put it crudely (and in the words of Max Landis): When a person creates something they don't want to just "please themselves," they want to engage, have a conversation and converge with the ideas of others. As artists the need for feedback is a method to check ourselves and gain perspective so that our creations allow us to reach a better understanding. What I've set out to do is create a piece combining samplesform the earliest of our recorded history (limited to audio and videoclips of actuallive recordings from 1800s and onward). ALongside that project, I've set out to create another piece that combines all of my favorite samples of music and video.What's in here is a temporary project that deals with the format I'd like to have in the bigger project. </p>
